#Huesday – The Color of Your Day
Huesday is a simple and beautiful way to track your daily moods using colors. At the end of each day, you’ll get a reminder to choose a color that reflects how you felt. Each color becomes a pixel on your yearly mood map. Over time, you’ll see the unique pattern of your year—a vibrant mosaic that tells your personal story, one hue at a time.
