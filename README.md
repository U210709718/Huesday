# ðŸŽ¨ Huesday â€“ The Color of Your Day
Huesday is a simple and beautiful way to track your daily moods using colors.
At the end of each day, youâ€™ll be reminded to choose a color that best reflects how you felt. Each color becomes a pixel in your yearly mood map â€” a visual diary of your emotions.

Why am I creating Huesday?
I discovered the Year in Pixels idea in a blog post â€” a full sheet of paper where each square represented a day. It was such a smart, elegant way to track emotions. 
[ðŸ“„ View the the real a year in a pixel](https://mylearningtolearn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Year-in-Pixels-Grid-1.png)
But carrying that paper around? That was hard. I kept losing it or forgetting to fill it in. Yet the concept stuck with me. 

I felt like This is one of those ideas that deserves to live as an app.
So I created Huesday.

ðŸ§  Why It Matters
Each day is a pixel, and your year becomes a colorful canvas of your emotional journey.

For example:
A happy day might be bright yellow ðŸŒž
A calm day, light blue ðŸŒŠ
A stressful day, red
After a few weeks, you start to see patterns â€” are Mondays usually blue? Do holidays bring joy or stress?
