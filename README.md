# Huesday â€“ The Color of Your Day
Huesday is a simple and beautiful way to track your daily moods using colors. At the end of each day, youâ€™ll get a reminder to choose a color that reflects how you felt. Each color becomes a pixel on your yearly mood map. Over time, youâ€™ll see the unique pattern of your yearâ€”a vibrant mosaic that tells your personal story, one hue at a time.
