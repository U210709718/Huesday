# 🎨 Huesday – The Color of Your Day

**Huesday** is a simple and beautiful way to track your daily moods using colors.

At the end of each day, you’ll be reminded to choose a color that best reflects how you felt. Each color becomes a **pixel** in your **yearly mood map** — a visual diary of your emotions.

## 💡 Why I’m Creating Huesday

I first came across the **"Year in Pixels"** idea in a blog post — a full sheet of paper where each square represents a day. It was a smart, elegant way to reflect on your emotions over time.

But carrying that paper around? That was *hard*. I kept misplacing it or forgetting to fill it in. Still, the concept stuck with me.

I remember thinking:  
**“This is one of those ideas that deserves to live as an app.”**  
So, I started building **Huesday**.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

Each day is a pixel — and over time, your year becomes a colorful canvas of your emotional journey.

For example:
- 🌞 A happy day might be **bright yellow**
- 🌊 A calm day might be **light blue**
- 🔴 A stressful day might be **red**

After a few weeks, you start to see patterns:
- Are your Mondays usually blue?
- Do holidays bring joy or stress?
- Is there a seasonal mood shift?

This simple act of color-logging can reveal deep insights about your mental and emotional well-being.
